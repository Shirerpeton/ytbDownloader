# ytbDownloader

Nodejs console script that downloads video and audio from youtube.

To convert downloaded files into common formats (mkv/mp4 or aac/mp3) and to package both audio and video streams into one container ffmpeg is used. 
ffmpeg should go into ./ffmpeg directory beside compiled js files. Output files would be placed into ./output directory.
